// Make a typing speed test application. When the page loads, randomly show one sentence from an array of sentences. Start a timer when the user starts typing inside the input box. When they finish typing (same text as displayed), stop the timer and show how many seconds it took. Add a “Try Again” button that resets everything and shows a new random sentence. You must handle all these actions with pure DOM manipulation and JavaScript timers.
