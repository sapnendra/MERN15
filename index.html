          <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
          <p>
            HTML, or <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is the standard
            markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
            browser. It is the fundamental building block of the web. Think of
            it as the <strong>skeleton</strong> of a webpage, providing the
            structure and content, such as text, images, and links. Without
            HTML, you can't have a webpage! It uses a system of tags to define
            elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists.

          <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
          <p>
            CSS, or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a stylesheet
            language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
            HTML. If HTML is the skeleton, then CSS is the
            <strong>skin and clothes</strong>. It's what makes the website look
            good! CSS controls the layout of multiple webpages at once and
            handles the colors, fonts, and spacing. It separates the
            presentation from the content, making web design more efficient and
            flexible.

          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create
            dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
            and much more. It's the <strong>brain</strong> of the operation.
            While HTML gives the page structure and CSS makes it look good,
            JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. It allows a user
            to interact with the webpage and for the webpage to respond in
            real-time without needing to reload. Many modern websites and web
            applications are built with JavaScript.
